# soulfire

An experimental mod API for Minecraft. You probably don't want to use this.

soulfire does not expose **any** Minecraft code, but wraps it in a higher-level API.

The name is lowercase. DO NOT capitalise it.

## Why?

- I was bored.
- I hated touching Minecraft code directly when writing mods.
- I hate the idea that mods need to be postprocessed to reobfuscate.

If Forge and Fabric expose Minecraft's APIs directly, soulfire is more like Bukkit.
